# Distortion Effect

This effect distorts the input signal. It currently includes the following features:
- `Drive`: Controls the amount of distortion applied.
- `Range/Intensity`: Controls the intensity of the distortion.
- `Blend`: The ratio of the distorted and clean signals that are incorporated into the output.
- `Volume / Level`: The volume of the output signal.
